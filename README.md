This is a publish of my paid P2C Driver undetected for 8 Months Straight. Its an IOCTL NtLoad Based Driver made for personal usage & P2C(With PolyMorphism). This (was) undetected and I'm writing was as the time of posting this because I know this will become detected as soon as I publish this but it can be made undetected extremely easily.

Much like my BeKernelDriver Project, This one follows the same rules as just recoding it with a new structure and format and changing handles. Very simple.

I am releasing this to fuck over leak sellers, My source has been leaked and has been resold by lots of people and after this I am just sick of it and the idiots I have to deal with.
This is an IOCTL NtLoad Driver, Not a Valorant HVCI SMM FaceIT RootKit Fuckover and I never understand why these children go crazy over it.

I am moving on to update and develop my new Manual Mapped Driver developed for VGK & FaceIT. This will never be my best work and will never be (MY) Work because I can do better.

Fuck Leak Sellers and Skids, Go buy DemonEye -> demoneye.cc | .gg/Wwtk4y8zgu
